          <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>
            Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937, and
            is the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat). His biological maternal
            grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group
            founder Jamsetji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata,
            had belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan therefore was a Tata
            by birth. Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was
            10, and he was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata,
            his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally adopted him through the
            J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage. He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from
            Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata), with whom he was
            raised. His first language is Gujarati.

            He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class,
            followed by Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai and at Bishop
            Cotton School in Shimla, and, in 1955, graduated from Riverdale
            Country School in New York City.In 1959, he then received a degree
            in Architecture from Cornell University, and in 1975, attended the
            seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School —
            an institution which he has since endowed.

            Promoted to management during the 1970s, Ratan achieved initial
            success by turning Group company National Radio and Electronics
            (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.
            In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming
            him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced
            stiff resistance from many companies heads, some of whom had spent
            decades in their respective companies and rose to become very
            powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD
            Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age, and then
            made individual companies report operationally to the group office
            and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the
            Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent
            was infused and given responsibilities.Under his stewardship,
            overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a
            synergised whole, with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated
            businesses to take on globalisation.

            During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40
            times, and profit, over 50 times.Where sales of the group as a
            whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities when he took over, the
            majority sales came from brands when he exited.He boldly got Tata
            Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and
            Tata Steel to acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely
            India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues
            coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries. He
            conceptualised the Tata Nano car.In 2015, He explained in an
            interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging
            Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant
            because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the
            average Indian consumer.

            Ratan Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28
            December 2012, upon turning 75 and Board of Directors and Legal
            division refused to appoint Cyrus Mistry as a successor of
            44-year-old son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group,
            the largest individual shareholder of the group and related by
            marriage.On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as the
            chairman of Tata Sons and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. The
            decision went through intense media scrutiny that made many
            scrutinize the root causes of the sudden removal, and the resultant
            crisis.A selection committee was formed to find a successor. The
            selection committee consisted of Mr. Tata, TVS Group head Venu
            Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of Bain Capital, former diplomat Ronen Sen
            and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya. All of them, except Mr. Bhattacharya,
            were on the board of Tata Sons.On 12 January 2017, Natarajan
            Chandrasekaran was named as the chairman of Tata Sons, a role he
            assumed in February 2017.

            Vehicles from its Sanand Plant in Gujarat,regarding which Ratan
            Tata said, "Tigor indicates a willingness to fast-forward India's
            electric dream. The government has set an ambitious target to have
            only electric cars by 2030.
